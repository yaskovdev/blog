# Developer Notes

## Build and run locally

Set the next environment variable to build and run locally: `set JEKYLL_ENV=development`.

Once the environment variable is set, just run `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

## Build for production

Set the next environment variable to build for production (e.g. to see Disqus comments and Google Analytics): `set JEKYLL_ENV=production` (note that default value is `development`).

Once the environment variable is set, just run `jekyll build`.
