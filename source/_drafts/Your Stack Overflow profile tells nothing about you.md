Your Stack Overflow profile tells nothing about you

"How to exit vim?" got 37428 votes, however it should be downvoted with a comment "You didn't show the research effort. Do not ask stupid questions. Read documentation instead." It was even mentioned in the article: "5% of SO traffic is because of this question".
Am I envying? Maybe.

Idea: test "Встроить Stack Overflow (с помощью его API) в сайт (спроси у Лены как)" here.
