excerpt: "Consistency: a blessing or a curse for quality?"

Let's not use constructor based dependency injection here, because we have always been using setter-based dependency injection, so let's stick to it for consistency.

For consistency... I've heard this phrase many times. It's a good phrase, but it's not always a good reason to do something. Consistency is a killer of quality.

But wait, isn't consistency actually a good thing? Doesn't it make life easier when the system behaves predictably in similar situations, i.e., when the system is predictable and consistent?
