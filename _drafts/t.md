How do you fix an issue?

1. Understand the root cause of the issue
2. Eliminate the root cause
There is another approach called «Try this and that and hope it will fix the issue», however I wouldn’t recommend using it.

Now, I believe that usually 1 takes much more time and effort that 2. Let's pay more attention to 1.

You have 2 ways to understand the root cause: you can guess or you can read what was the cause using one of sources of information.

The main sources of information are:

1. Logs
2. Responses to your requests
3. Debugging

### To Summarize

Having super fast access to the sources of information is very mega important. Once you start working on a product, make sure you have all the accesses at hand.
